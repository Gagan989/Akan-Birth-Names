    <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. This program basically calulates your Akhan age based on a Ghanian tradition to name new borns based on which day of the week they were born.</p>
